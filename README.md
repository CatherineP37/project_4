# Medical Appointment Booking App

This is an app that helps to make it easy for patients to book appointments at
a medical centre. The app helps to reduce the number of calls coming through to
the medical centre. This means that the patients who do call in don't have to
wait as long for their call to be answered.

## Scope

The following must be included in the app:

- Patient log in screen
- Sign up form for new account
- Booking form
- List of available appointments
- Ability to view booked appointments
- Ability to cancel appointments

It's not necessary to include the following in the app:

- Doctor log in screen
- Patient notes
